# Medicare_query
In this repository I'm exploring the query functionality of Llama_Index on a selection publically-available Medicare documents.
The pipeline is as such:
Load the pdf's
Create a local folder to hold the vector database from pdf embeddigns
query the vector database using API call to OpenAi's LLM.
